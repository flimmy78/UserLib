UserLib
=======

	UserLib is a C++ Framework with a C-Kernel. The C-Kernel contains a
	thread-safe managed memory allocator and a set of functions implementing
	standard data structures. The C++ Framework uses the generic feature, ie
	templates, very sparingly. Modern C++ features are also not included.
	
	Classic C++ is used as wrapper around the C-Kernel, OS-specific functions 
	and third-party-software. That way the library is easy to use and there is 
	full control of most implementation details. And it is complete, it contains 
	everything to build an application.
