ABOUT UserLib

	UserLib is a C++ Framework with a C-Kernel. The C-Kernel contains a
	thread-safe managed memory allocator and a set of functions implementing
	standard data structures. The C++ Framework uses the generic feature, ie
	templates, very sparingly. Modern C++ features are also not included.
	
	Basic C++ is used as wrapper around the C-Kernel, OS-specific functions 
	and third-party-software. That way the library is easy to use. And it is 
	complete, it contains everything to build an application.
