ABOUT UserLib

	UserLib is a C++ Framework with a C-Kernel. The C-Kernel contains a
	thread-safe managed memory allocator and a set of functions implementing
	standard data structures. The C++ Framework uses the generic feature, ie
	templates, very sparingly. Modern C++ features are also not included.
	
	Basic C++ is used as wrapper around the C-Kernel, OS-specific functions 
	and third-party-software. That way the library is easy to use. And it is 
	complete, it contains everything to build an application.
	
	A list of third-party-software is included in INSTALL file. There is
	also an information given, which source files are involved in each 
	third-party-software.
	
	UserLib supports configuration of the application by using the command 
	line and properties files. Any disk file can be read in, downloaded from
	the internet or a database connection can be opened. The data manipulation
	process is supported by common data structures.
