The C-Kernel contains a\r\n\tthread-safe managed memory allocator and a set of functions implementing\r\n\tstandard data structures. The C++ Framework uses the generic feature, ie\r\n\ttemplates, very sparingly. Modern C++ features are also not included.\r\n\t\r\n\tBasic C++ is used as wrapper around the C-Kernel, OS-specific functions \r\n\tand third-party-software. That way the library is easy to use. And it is \r\n\tcomplete, it contains everything to build an application.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
